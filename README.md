### From The Author 🧑‍🎓

**The PointsApp is an educational project.** It aims to acquire technical skills by me. It will not be developed commercially.

Also it is worth to tell that it is my first React project. Everything here is new for me. I decided that it would be a good idea to create my own application which is more or less based on guides found on the Internet. In the project, I also tried to look for information in the documentation if I encountered a problem (I want to learn how to navigate through the documentation).

This project is a huge challenge for me. Every day I learn something new with it because it gives me a lot of trouble.
