# PointsApp

All of important things are below. **Be careful** - the app is still in development!

## About The App

Points App is the app where you can collect points for completing challenges. It is some sort of social media platform where you can follow other users and see their timeline. Points is an application that allows you to experience unforgettable moments and enjoy your life better. Special challenges prepared by our creative team will give you many ideas on how you can spend unforgettable moments with a dose of competition between your friends. Interesting tasks give you the opportunity to get to know the world better. Thanks to them, you can spend an amazing day individually or with friends.

> I am a student of the Warsaw University of Technology (Faculty of Management, Management Engineering) who would like to develop in creating web and mobile applications. I am a person who is not afraid of new challenges and who enjoys meeting people and working with them on interesting projects. I believe that my curiosity towards the world is my strongest trait and makes me try to constantly set myself and achieve new goals.

## From The Author

**The PointsApp is an educational project.** It aims to acquire technical skills by me. It will not be developed commercially.

Also it is worth to tell that it is my first React project. Everything here is new for me. I decided that it would be a good idea to create my own application which is more or less based on guides found on the Internet. In the project, I also tried to look for information in the documentation if I encountered a problem (I want to learn how to navigate through the documentation).

This project is a huge challenge for me. Every day I learn something new with it.
